## 2 Player Pong

**Github Repository:** *Coming Soon*

**Paper Link:** [Paper Link]()

**Techniques Explored:** Finite State Machines, Simulation, Circuit Design, Testing

**Skills Demonstrated:** System Verilog, ModelSim

**Project description:** The purpose of this lab was to implement everything learned in my Introduction to Digital Circuits and Systems course. A 2-player pong game was created on a DEC_SoC development board with an 8x8 LED Matrix as the play field. Key's on the board were used to move the padels and switches were used to reset the game and adjust the game ball speed. The score is recorded on two 7-segment displays and the winner is the first player to reach 7. Click on the paper link for the full report.
